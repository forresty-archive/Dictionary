Simple offline Dictionary app for iOS 5+ built with UIReferenceLibraryViewController

App Store rejected since, well, [UIReferenceLibraryViewController](http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/uikit/reference/UIReferenceLibraryViewControllerClassRef/Reference/Reference.html)
is not meant to be used to build a standalone dictionary app.

Was a shameless rip-off of http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dictionary/id473493861
